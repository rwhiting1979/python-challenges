# PyBank and PyPoll Data Analysis

## PyBank

### Overview

**PyBank** is a Python script that analyzes financial records from a CSV file named "budget_data.csv." It calculates various financial metrics, including the total number of months, net total profits/losses, average change in profits/losses, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits. The analysis results are both displayed in the terminal and exported to a text file.

### Actions Taken

1. Created a project structure with folders for PyBank.
2. Placed the "budget_data.csv" file in the "Resources" folder.
3. Developed the `main.py` script to read and analyze the financial data.
4. Calculated the required financial metrics.
5. Printed the analysis summary to the terminal.
6. Exported the same analysis results to a text file named "financial_analysis.txt" in the "Analysis" folder.

## PyPoll

It calculates various election statistics, including the total number of votes cast, a list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. The analysis results are both displayed in the terminal and exported to a text file.

### Actions Taken

1. Created a project structure with folders for PyPoll.
2. Placed the "election_data.csv" file in the "Resources" folder.
3. Developed the `main.py` script to read and analyze the election data.
